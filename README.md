# Seko-backend
Node.js backend codes to connect MySQL and email service to provide RESTful API

It should work with Seko-frontend in another repository.
After downloading the code to your PC, 
please use npm install and nodemon index.js to run the project in localhost:/4000.

Currently, I cannot upload .sql file to Github because of the security of company's information,
which makes the getWallpaper GET request cannot connect with Mysql database.

I will add a new project for seko employees to check the to do list and stock later
